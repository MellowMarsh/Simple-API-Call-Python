# Simple-API-Call-Python

## A Simple Api call using a GET Request and parsing that data.

###  Create a python script (script.py) that pulls the same data but also writes a data.json file. This simple script can be used/modified for other Rest API GET requests. Create a for loop that parses that data.


1.  Before running the (script.py) create a data.json file.
2.  Locate the url you want to  use to make the API GET request.
3.  After running the python (script.py) the data will be returned in the data.json file
