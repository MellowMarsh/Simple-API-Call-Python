# Simple-API-Call-Python

A Simple Api call using a GET Request and parsing that data.

Create a python script (script.py) that pulls the same data but also writes a data.json file. This simple script can be used/modified for other Rest API GET requests.

Locate the urls to make the API GET request. "url" + "parameters"

Before running the (script.py) create a data.json file.
After running the python (script.py) the data will be returned in the data.json file.
